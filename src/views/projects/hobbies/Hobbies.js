              I have watched F1 from an early age, and I remember watching it
              with my dad, when Robert Kubica was driving. Still, till this day
              I love watching it, even though our Polish driver is not there.

              I play the piano as a hobby, so I'm not even close to being the

              I don't have much knowledge of robotics, but I've always liked
              building things that are "touchable". So Arduino (which is not
              that complicated) allows me to do so and I have a lot of fun with
              it ðŸ˜„.

              Since, I like smartwatches (and wear one myself), I enjoy having a

              I was fencer for the 9 years and loved the sport, unfortunately I
              had to quit due to the lack of coaches in my hometown. But apart
              from that, since I was a child, my parents took me skiing every
              year, and I decided to continue this tradition ðŸ™‚.
